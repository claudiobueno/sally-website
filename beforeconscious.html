            <p>Before Conscious is a video art filmed and edited from two different takes, one from the painting process of one hand and the other from the process of washing the painting of the other hand.</p>

            <p>The concept worked on is based on two processes, often unconscious, of transformations and learning simultaneously from human living. Revealing the idea of the "subconscious dealing with who I was and who I am, or who I am and who I will be" at the same time.</p>

            <p>The fast pauses, mostly of just 1 second, that interlude the audio movements in the video, quickly reveal the two sides (represented by the Hands) in confrontation, as if they were small lapses of consciousness in the middle of the unconscious process of transforming.</p>

            <p>The change in colors represented on the left side of the screen reveals the overlapping of luggage, influences and different identities that are part of our transformation processes.</p>

            <p>In the end, the representation of “joining the palms of the hands” comes with the idea of hope for processes not yet finished, but that has this path with the same importance as our final product.</p>
