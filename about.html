            <h1>BIOGRAPHY <br><br></h1>
            <p>Sally Santiago (b.1996. São Paulo. BR) is a visual artist currently living and working in Aveiro, Portugal. She
            started her journey in plastic arts and craft activities as a child, her first memory is of embroidery made from
            banana leaves with lemon spines, since then she has been exploring different artistic formats. With an
            involvement and inspiration always focused on the greatness of nature, her work always brings debate
            between human experiences and their changing process, perception of themselves and their connection
            with spaces, the dwell in greatness. <br><br></p>
            <p>From organic forms, the visual representations presented in her paintings, digital works and video art,
            capture a little of the most ordinary human senses, simultaneously bringing to the surface the construction of
            meaning of what is generally seen as insignificant. Awakening hidden memories, submerging values or just
            accepting the path of processes is as valuable as art.<br><br></p>
            <p>Sally Santiago completed her study in social communication in 2017, moved to New Zealand and once again
            immersing in nature she was led to artistic extensions such as audiovisual experimental projects, besides
            contributing in contemporary art galleries. She is currently a Master's student in Contemporary Artistic
            Creation at the University of Aveiro and her journey continues as similar to her art, singular and full of intense
            and real processes. <br><br><br><br> </p>
